# geodesicLVQ_toolbox

This code demonstrates how Matrix Learning Vector Quantization models can be averaged to achieve an interpretable ensemble. Parts can also be used to find rank preserving averages of positive semi-definite matrices, as used in Large Margin Nearest Neighbors and others with adaptive quadratic forms. 

## Before you can start

### angle LVQ toolbox

To run this demo also download the angleLVQtoolbox available at:  
https://github.com/kbunte/angleLVQtoolbox.git  
and add it to the Matlab path before running the demo script.

### Manopt

Furthermore the Manopt, the Matlab toolbox for optimization on manifolds needs to be downloaded and added to the matlab path. 
For a description of the project, documentation, examples and more, see:
[http://www.manopt.org](http://www.manopt.org).


Manopt is released in numbered versions from time to time. For most users, it is easiest to download the latest numbered version from
