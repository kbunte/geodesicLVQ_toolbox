# geodesicLVQ_toolbox

This code demonstrates how Matrix Learning Vector Quantization models can be averaged to achieve an interpretable ensemble. Parts can also be used to find rank preserving averages of positive semi-definite matrices, as used in Large Margin Nearest Neighbors and others with adaptive quadratic forms. 

To run this demo also download the angleLVQtoolbox available at:  
https://github.com/kbunte/angleLVQtoolbox.git  
and add it to the Matlab path before running the demo script.
